## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of memristor-nn-simulator seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security reports to: daniel@terragonlabs.com
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)
- **Release**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

## Security Best Practices

When using memristor-nn-simulator:

### Input Validation
- Always validate external inputs before processing
- Use the built-in validation utilities in `memristor_nn.utils.validators`
- Sanitize file paths and network inputs

### Memory Management
- Monitor memory usage for large simulations
- Use the memory optimization tools in `memristor_nn.optimization.memory_optimizer`
- Set appropriate limits for crossbar array sizes

### File Operations
- Only read files from trusted locations
- Use the secure file path validation in `memristor_nn.utils.security`
- Avoid processing untrusted pickle files

### Network Security
- Validate all network configuration parameters
- Use TLS for distributed computing scenarios
- Implement proper authentication for multi-node setups

## Known Security Considerations

### Pickle Serialization
- The caching system uses pickle for serialization
- Only enable persistent caching in trusted environments
- Consider using JSON-based caching for untrusted scenarios

### Memory Usage
- Large crossbar arrays can consume significant memory
- Implement appropriate resource limits in production
- Monitor for potential DoS via memory exhaustion

### Code Injection
- User-provided device models could contain malicious code
- Only use device models from trusted sources
- Consider sandboxing for user-provided models

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections
